track_high_thresh: 0.5 # High confidence threshold for the first association (lower for more tolerance)
track_low_thresh: 0.1  # Low confidence threshold for the second association
new_track_thresh: 0.4  # Threshold for initializing a new track (lower for more tolerance)
track_buffer: 90       # Number of frames to buffer a lost track before deletion (higher for more stable IDs)
